# Stock Prediction App

A web application for predicting stock prices using the Prophet forecasting model and visualizing the results with Plotly.

## Description

The Stock Prediction App is built with Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. It allows users to select a stock from a list, choose the prediction period, and view both the historical and forecasted stock prices. The app fetches real-time data from Yahoo Finance and utilizes the Prophet library for time-series forecasting. The visualizations are generated using Plotly, enabling interactive exploration of the data.
